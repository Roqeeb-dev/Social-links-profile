- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I am still having some little problems with CSS grid hence the reason i refrained from using it in this challenge. So i will continue learning it till i understand it. I already edited it to center the div more properly. 

### Useful resources

- (w3schools.com) - This helped me in checking quick code samples and reminding me of important concepts that i have forgotten.
- (youtube.com) - This was also invaluable during the execution of the project.
- (Telegram.com) - More precisely, Angela Yu's channel really helped with crystal clear explantions and lots of practice exercises. Also on the same platform, Some other channels helped with useful tips for centering the div.
